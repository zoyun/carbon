## Overview

Code snippets are strings or small blocks of reusable code that are copyable. We
don't provide the copy functionality and recommend
[clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/).

## Skeleton state

You can use the `CodeSnippetSkeleton` component to render a skeleton variant of
an code snippet. This is useful to display while content in your code snippet is
being fetched from an external resource like an API.

Multiple line code snippets are used for displaying code with more than one
line. They're shown in a block and useful for showing classes, functions, blocks
of styles and the like.

without wrapping. Useful for calling out terminal commands, function
invocations, expressions etc.
